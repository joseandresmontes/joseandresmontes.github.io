## Abstract 

This article aims to showcase Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to analyze sentiment and topics in complaints filed at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The techniques covered include data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. The study focuses on the top three consumer credit agencies because of their data abundance, similar market size, and importance in the personal finance field. Findings show that there is a rise in complaints overall with no discernable difference in sentiment across the three agencies. All agencies however had opinionated negative complaints. Topic modeling found identity theft as an emerging topic since 2017.
